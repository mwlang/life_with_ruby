# Tim Conway's Game of Life in CoffeeScript

Inspired by a [Jonathan Wallace](https://github.com/wallace)'s invite to a local [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/about) (that I could not attend)
where the gathered developers were going to focus on Tim Conway's Game of Life, I decided to embark on a self-study of CoffeeScript where 
my skills are relatively weak.

This is the results of my implementing the Game of Life in CoffeeScript and you'll find the code directly in source/javascripts/game.js.coffeescript 
and you can read more about the code and effort [with this blog post](http://ramblings.gibberishcode.net/archives/conways-game-of-life-in-coffeescript/125)

This project was implemented with [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com/) in a Ruby 2.0 development environment.  Follow the Middleman Getting Started 
guide to install Middleman then launch the app with:

  ```middleman server```
